// 👷🏽‍♂️🧱 HOW TO PLAN A WEB PROJECT

// 📌 STEP 1: User Stories 🧑🏽‍💻📖
// 👉🏽 User story: Is a description of the application’s functionality from the user’s perspective.
// 👉🏽 Common Format: As a [type of user (Who? Example: User, Admin, etc)] I want [an action (What?)] so that [a benefit(Why?)]
// Example: # As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute, so I can keep a log of all my running
// Example: # As a user, I want to also see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I work out the most

// 📌 STEP 2: Features ✅
// 👉🏽 Feature: A feature is a user story that is not yet implemented.
// Example:
// The user story:
// # As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute, so I can keep a log of all my running
// The feature(s) based on the user story:
// ~ Map where user clicks to add new workout(best way to get location coordinates);
// ~ Geolocation to display map at current location (more user friendly)
// ~ Form to input distance, time, pace, steps/minute
// Example:
// The user story: # As a user, I want to also see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I work out the most
// The feature(s) based on the user story:
// ~ Display all workouts on the map

// 📌 STEP 3: Flowchart 📊
// 👉🏽 A flowchart is a diagram that shows the sequence of steps that a software project will take.
// 👉🏽 To visualize the different actions that a user can take, and how the program react to these actions, we usually put all these features into a nice flow chart.

// 📌 STEP 4: ARCHITECTURE ⚙️
// 👉🏽 Architecture: Is how we build our application. (Structure of project (code, database, etc.))

// 🛠 HOW TO STRUCTURE A WEB PROJECT
// 🎯 STEP 1: Data Architecture
// 👉🏽 decide where and how to store the data.
// 👉🏽 data can come from anywhere (user stories [user input], API, local storage, etc.)
// 👉🏽 we can use classes to hold (structure) the data and methods to manipulate it.

// 🎯 STEP 2: Event Handling Architecture
// 👉🏽 decide how to handle events.
// 👉🏽 create different functions that will handle these different events. (click, mouseover, etc.)
// 👉🏽 we can create a big class 'App' that holds all the functiuons(events) as methods.
